# About

Experiment with godot 3d for learning purposes. Game is a single player fps with fast movement, quick reloads and "realistic" recoil. Incorporates finite state machines with nav meshes to create
a belivable enemy. Jump pads and explosive shotguns provide flying fun all around the map. Designed with a simplistic artstyle.
